# SufferTree

## Introduction
This is intended to visualize a suffix tree in python.  
You probably have to modify it as we have different way 
to represent the graph.  Visit `gen.py` to do so.

## Dependencies
Requires `graphviz`, use `virtualenv` and install it.

## Usage
Call `main.visualize(root)` with your root node, 
hopefully an image viewer will show up with your tree.  
Path is not handled, you probably have to put your scripts 
with this under the same directory.

## Note
* Bug fix, enhancement?  Create PR instead of issue if possible.
