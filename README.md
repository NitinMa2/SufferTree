# SufferTree

## Introduction
This is intended to visualize a suffix tree in python.  I didn't code everything here.  Expect it to be buggy, try to 
fix it before you complain it.

## Usage
Call `main.simple_start(root)` with your root node to fire up a http server and open your browser, hopefully with your 
tree visualized.  Path is not handled, you probably have to put your scripts with this under the same directory.

## Note
* As of now, it doesn't handle anything more than label.
* Bug fix, enhancement?  Create PR instead of issue if possible.
